# Beat Maker App — Project Idea

## Summary

A phone-first web app that lets you record sound snippets from your mic, build up a library ("arsenal") of them, and turn them into a beat using dial-based controls. Casual, personal-use project — no saving/export needed, no offline requirement. Scope is expected to grow organically over time, so the foundation is built solid even though the current feature set is small.

Originally built as one continuously-scrolling page; restructured into a small multi-page app shell once real use showed the dials and the sequencer needed to not compete for screen space with the pad grid or each other. See **Layout** below.

## Architecture Foundations

These are load-bearing decisions made deliberately so the base doesn't need to be re-poured as features get added later.

- **Language: TypeScript, strict mode.** The pad/sample/pattern/effect shapes are the contract between the audio engine and the UI — TypeScript keeps that contract enforced as both sides grow.
- **Audio engine: a decoupled module, not hooks.** All `AudioContext`, node graph, and scheduler logic lives in a plain TS class/module with no React dependency. React components call its methods and subscribe to its state; they never touch `AudioContext` directly. This means:
  - Audio timing is never at the mercy of a React re-render.
  - The scheduler can be unit-tested in Vitest with zero DOM.
  - The engine can be swapped, extended, or driven from something other than this UI later without a rewrite.
- **State: centralized reducer, not scattered `useState`.** One typed app-state shape (samples, pads, patterns, transport) updated through a reducer via `useReducer` + context. Still "plain React state" as originally scoped — just organized so state changes are traceable actions instead of ad hoc setters spread across components.
- **Data model: headroom built in now.** Effects are modeled as an ordered list per pad, not three hardcoded fields. Patterns are modeled as a collection, not a single hardcoded grid. The UI today only exposes one pattern and three effects (pitch/speed/filter) — but adding a second pattern or a fourth effect later is adding data, not restructuring core state. See **Data Model** below for the concrete shapes.
- **Tooling defaults** (not asked about, applying as sensible defaults for a "don't build flimsy" project): ESLint + Prettier from the start, Vitest for the engine/reducer/scheduler logic, strict `tsconfig`.

## Core Features

### Recording & the Sample Library ("Arsenal")

- Record multiple sound snippets from the device mic.
- Every recording lands in a persistent (session-lifetime) **sample library** — a growing arsenal of snippets, independent of pads.
- After recording stops, you're prompted to assign the new snippet to a pad — but the snippet also stays in the library regardless, so it can be reassigned or reused later.
- Pads **reference** a library sample by ID; they don't own the audio data. Reassigning a pad to a different library sample doesn't delete the old sample — it just changes what that pad points to.
- Also support looping/layering a single snippet on its own.
- Pads triggered by click/tap (no keyboard shortcuts).
- Pad count: adjustable, default 8.

### Pad Playback Behavior

- **Pad body tap: always a one-shot.** Tapping the pad itself always just plays it once, full stop — no mode, no toggle, always the same behavior. Looping is a separate, explicit action.
- **Loop button: starts or stops a loop directly, in one tap.** A dedicated loop control on each pad — not tap to start then a separate tap on the pad body to stop. Tap it once while not looping and the pad starts looping immediately; tap it again and it stops. Its visual on/off state is driven directly by whether the pad is actually looping right now, not a separately-stored preference — there's nothing else it could mean. (This replaced an earlier design where a pad had a persisted `loop` mode that changed what tapping the pad body did — confusing in practice, since you had to remember which mode a pad was in. Looping is now purely a live, momentary engine state, not app data.)
- **Retriggering a one-shot pad**: layers freely — each tap fires a new overlapping playback instance, standard sampler behavior. This is also what naturally happens when a manual tap coincides with a sequencer step firing the same pad; no special-casing needed.
- **Shrinking pad count**: purely a display/trigger-surface control. Data for pads above the new count is retained in state, not deleted, and reappears if the count is grown back. (No confirmation dialog needed since nothing is actually discarded — this only applies to pad *slots*; explicitly deleting a sample from the library or clearing a pad is a separate, deliberate action.)
- **Mute**: independent of loop and of having a sample assigned — a muted pad produces no sound at all, from a manual tap or a sequencer step, without losing its sample assignment or its programmed steps. Visually dimmed so it's clear why tapping it does nothing. Distinct from "empty" (no sample) and from clearing a pad's data.

## Dials / Controls

- Audio effect dials: pitch, speed, filter — per-pad (each pad has its own settings, independent of which library sample it currently references).
  - **Range is bipolar: -100 (full one way) .. 0 (neutral, no change) .. +100 (full the other way)**, not 0–100 with 50 as an implicit midpoint — "50%" reads as "half speed," which is misleading when 50 actually meant neutral. 0 always means "no change" now. Dials snap to 25-point anchors (-100, -75, -50, ... 100), so a drag to 76 lands on 75.
  - **Speed → `AudioBufferSourceNode.playbackRate`.** -100 = 0.5x, 0 = 1x (unchanged), +100 = 2x.
  - **Pitch → `AudioBufferSourceNode.detune`.** Plain `playbackRate` changes pitch and speed together (it's just resampling) — using `detune` for pitch keeps the two dials genuinely independent without needing a phase vocoder or other heavy DSP. -1200..+1200 cents (one octave either way), 0 at dial 0. This only works within `detune`'s practical range; that's an accepted limitation, not a bug.
  - **Filter → a bipolar tone control**, not a one-directional sweep: negative values progressively muffle (lowpass, cutoff dropping as the dial goes further negative), positive values progressively thin the sound out (highpass, cutoff rising), 0 is neutral (`allpass`, negligible audible effect — kept in the graph rather than removed, so the node topology never changes while a pad loops). A single `BiquadFilterNode` whose `type` and `frequency` both change with the dial.
  - **Changes apply live to a pad that's currently looping** — dragging a dial audibly updates the sustained sound in real time (via `AudioParam.setTargetAtTime` for a click-free ramp), not just the next trigger. One-shot instances already in flight aren't retroactively editable (there's no single "the" instance once several are layered).
- Rhythm dials: beat pattern / step sequencer controls, 16-step grid.
- Tempo: adjustable BPM dial for the sequencer (range 40–240).
- **Metronome**: an optional synthesized click (no sample/asset — a short oscillator blip) on quarter-note beats, accented on the pattern's downbeat, toggled independently of the pads.
- Every slider in the app earns its place as a slider (BPM, the three dials) — continuous ranges where fine control matters. Discrete, coarse, rarely-adjusted settings (pad count) use a stepper (−/+ buttons) instead, since a slider is the wrong control for "occasionally nudge an integer between 1 and 16."
- Every dial (and the trim control) has a tap-to-open info icon explaining what it does — tap, not hover, since hover doesn't exist on the phone this app targets.

## Layout

A small app shell — persistent global chrome around four pages, no router library (a plain page/navigation React context is enough for four flat destinations with no need for URLs or browser history):

- **Top nav** (fixed): three page tabs — **Pads** (home), **Sequencer**, **Library** — plus two utility actions reachable from anywhere: a panic **"stop all sounds"** button (silences every loop, every in-flight one-shot, and pauses the sequencer, all at once) and a **settings** gear (pad count, Clear All — opens as an overlay, tucked away since it's touched rarely).
- **Bottom PlayBar** (fixed, global on every page): play/pause, BPM, loop-once-vs-continuous, metronome. Shapes *how* playback sounds; deliberately kept separate from the top nav's utility actions, which are about getting around and emergency control instead.
- **Floating record button** (fixed, global on every page): press-and-hold to record — the hold itself *is* the recording gesture, release stops it, however long that was. Recording was never tied to one screen or page; a name/waveform-preview/assign-or-discard review appears as a modal overlay regardless of where you started recording from, so it's never blocked by which page happens to be open.
- **Pads page (home)**: the pad grid is the hero content, full width, nothing sharing space with it. Casual interactions stay directly on the pad — tap to play (always one-shot), a loop toggle, a mute toggle, live "playing"/"looping" visual feedback. Tapping a pad also surfaces a small summary bar below the grid with an explicit **"Edit Sound"** action — the only way into the next page, so casual play/loop/mute never gets tangled up with deliberate editing.
- **Pad edit page** (reached via "Edit Sound," not a nav tab — a drill-down detail view, not a top-level destination): the per-pad dials (pitch/speed/filter) and the trim editor get the entire page. A back button returns to Pads. Shows the pad's live playing/looping state at the top, since you're often adjusting a sound while it's audible.
- **Sequencer page**: the 16-step grid gets its own page, meant to be visited once the pads are filled in and it's time to assemble a pattern — not something you're nudging past while trying to do something else. Each row shows a small pulsing badge (and a ring around its pad-number circle) whenever that pad is independently looping via the pad-page loop button, so the sequencer's own step pattern is never mistaken for — or silently coexisting unnoticed with — a separate loop already playing.
- **Library page**: the sample list (rename, reorder, delete, assign, waveform thumbnails) gets its own page too, tucked out of the way of the pads — it's for occasional housekeeping, not something that needs to compete with the main pad-focused screen.

## Data Model

Illustrative shape — the actual types will live in code, but this is the structure the reducer, engine, and UI are all built against:

```ts
type EffectId = 'pitch' | 'speed' | 'filter'; // extensible — more effect types can be added later

interface EffectSetting {
  id: EffectId;
  value: number; // -100..100, 0 = neutral/no change, mapped internally to the real audio param
}

interface Sample {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  buffer: AudioBuffer;
  recordedAt: number;
  peaks: number[];            // precomputed waveform thumbnail (0-1 amplitudes)
}

interface Pad {
  id: string;
  sampleId: string | null;   // reference into the library, not ownership
  // No `loop: boolean` here — whether a pad is looping is live engine state
  // (AudioEngine.isPadLooping), not a persisted mode. Tapping the pad body
  // always plays a one-shot; the loop button starts/stops an actual loop.
  muted: boolean;            // silences taps and sequencer steps alike, independent of sample
  color: string;             // assigned at pad creation, stable identity
  icon: string;
  effects: EffectSetting[];  // ordered list, not fixed fields
  trimStart: number;         // 0-1, non-destructive playback window into the sample
  trimEnd: number;           // resets to (0, 1) whenever a different sample is assigned
}

interface Pattern {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  steps: Record<string /* padId */, boolean[]>; // 16-length boolean arrays
}

interface Transport {
  bpm: number;                          // 40–240
  isPlaying: boolean;
  loopMode: 'once' | 'continuous';
  currentStep: number;
  metronomeEnabled: boolean;
}

interface AppState {
  samples: Record<string, Sample>;   // the arsenal, keyed by id
  sampleOrder: string[];             // display/edit order for the library
  pads: Pad[];                       // every pad slot that has ever existed — never truncated
  visiblePadCount: number;           // how many pads (from the front of `pads`) are shown/triggerable
  patterns: Pattern[];               // only one is used/exposed today
  activePatternId: string;
  transport: Transport;
}
```

`pads.length` and `visiblePadCount` are deliberately separate: shrinking the pad count only lowers `visiblePadCount` (display-only), while `pads` itself only ever grows — this is what makes "shrink retains hidden data" representable without a separate archive structure.

## Saving

- None needed. Session-only, resets on reload. This is for messing around, not producing/exporting finished tracks.

## Platform

- Runs in browser. "PWA" in name only for now — no offline support or installability required.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript (strict) + Web Audio API
- Vite for build tooling
- Centralized reducer (`useReducer` + context) for app state — no external state library
- ESLint + Prettier

## Infrastructure & Logic Notes

- **Audio engine**: a standalone module owning one `AudioContext`. Each library sample is decoded once into an `AudioBuffer` (`MediaRecorder` → `decodeAudioData`); pads trigger playback by looking up their referenced sample and building a fresh `AudioBufferSourceNode` → effect chain → destination at trigger time.
- **Dials**: 0–100% sliders per pad, mapped internally to audio params as described above (detune for pitch, playbackRate for speed, filter frequency for filter).
- **Scheduler — lookahead pattern, not naive `setInterval`.** A naive `setInterval` that fires audio directly drifts and jitters against the main thread (GC pauses, re-renders). Instead: a `setTimeout`-based polling loop runs frequently (e.g. every 25ms) and, on each poll, schedules any step events that fall within a short lookahead window (e.g. next 100ms) against `AudioContext.currentTime` — the actual sound-triggering is scheduled on the audio clock, not fired synchronously from the timer. BPM changes just change the interval math; nothing else about the pattern changes.
- **No persistence**: state lives in memory only, resets on page reload.

## Build Steps

- [ ] Set up Vite + React + TypeScript project (strict mode), ESLint + Prettier, Vitest
- [ ] Define core data model types (`Sample`, `Pad`, `Pattern`, `Transport`, `AppState`) and the reducer + actions
- [ ] Build the audio engine module (AudioContext lifecycle, sample decode, trigger/stop/choke API) — no UI yet, covered by Vitest
- [ ] Build the lookahead scheduler inside the engine, unit-tested against BPM→interval math independent of real audio
- [ ] Build basic layout: recording area, library shelf, pad grid, sequencer grid, dial areas (single page)
- [ ] Implement mic recording (`MediaRecorder`), decode to `AudioBuffer`, add to library on stop
- [ ] Wire library samples to pads (assign/reassign by reference, not copy)
- [ ] Implement pad click/tap to play its sound via the engine; wire loop-toggle and free-layering retrigger behavior
- [ ] Add per-pad dials (pitch/speed/filter) as 0–100% sliders, wired to audio params through the engine
- [ ] Build 16-step sequencer grid per pad (toggle steps on/off) against the `Pattern` model
- [ ] Wire sequencer playback to the engine's scheduler
- [ ] Add adjustable BPM dial, wire to scheduler timing
- [ ] Add adjustable pad count control (default 8), confirm shrink/grow preserves hidden pad data as designed
- [ ] Polish/test: loop stability, no audio glitches, retrigger layering behaves, works across pads
- [ ] (Optional, later) Save/export if you change your mind

## Sound Sampling

- Mic input captured via `MediaRecorder` API, converted to an `AudioBuffer` and stored in the library, not directly on a pad.
- A pad holds a reference (`sampleId`) to one library entry; reassigning a pad changes the reference only — the library entry persists and can be reused by other pads.
- **Trim, per pad, non-destructive.** Each pad has its own trim window (`trimStart`/`trimEnd`, as fractions 0-1 of the sample's duration) into whichever library sample it references — dragged directly on a waveform display. The underlying recording is never altered; trim is purely a playback window applied via `AudioBufferSourceNode`'s native `offset`/`duration` (one-shot) or `loopStart`/`loopEnd` (looping) parameters, not by slicing/copying buffer data. Because it's per-pad rather than per-sample, the same recording can be trimmed differently on different pads — chopping one longer take across multiple pads, the way a hardware sampler's "chop" feature works. Resets to the full sample whenever a different sample is (re)assigned to that pad, since an old trim window has no correct meaning on a new recording's waveform.
- Playback rate, pitch (detune), and filter effects applied via Web Audio nodes at trigger time, not baked into the buffer — so the same library sample can sound different on different pads.
- A recording is not added to the library until you decide to keep it — "Discard recording" clears it without ever touching app state, so a bad take never clutters the library, even momentarily. "Keep in library only" or assigning it to a pad both commit it.

## Testing

- Manual testing for UI/interaction (pad clicks, dial drags, layout).
- Automated tests (Vitest) for logic that doesn't need a DOM or real audio hardware:
  - Reducer/action behavior (assigning samples, toggling steps, changing pad count).
  - Dial-value-to-audio-param mapping (0–100 → detune cents, playbackRate, filter frequency).
  - Scheduler timing: BPM-to-interval math, lookahead window scheduling, step advance — using a fake/mock clock rather than a real `AudioContext`, since the engine module is decoupled from the DOM by design.

## Deployment

- Hosted online via Vercel or Netlify (either works well with Vite + React, free tier is enough).
- Static build (`vite build`), no backend/server needed since there's no persistence.
- HTTPS required for mic access in the browser — both platforms provide this by default.

## Usage Flow (UI Details)

### Step 1 — Opening the app

- Lands on the Pads page. Pads show a clear empty/filled state (icon changes once a pad has a sample assigned).
- A floating record button, reachable from every page — recording was never meant to require being on a particular screen.

### Step 2 — Recording a sound

- Press and hold the record button to record; release to stop. No max length — however long you hold it. The hold gesture is the record/stop control; there's no separate start/stop tap to remember.
- Live waveform display while holding, for visual feedback.

### Step 3 — Reviewing, naming, and assigning (or discarding)

- After recording stops, you see a waveform preview and a name field, and you're prompted to choose which pad to assign it to (or "keep in library only," or discard it entirely).
- The recording isn't added to the library until you choose to keep it — discarding never touches the library, even briefly.
- If the chosen pad already has a sample assigned, you're asked to confirm before its reference is replaced — the old sample isn't deleted, just unassigned from that pad.

### Step 4 — Testing a pad / dials

- Tapping a pad body always just plays it once. A separate loop button on the pad starts or stops a continuous loop, in one tap each way — its on/off look always matches whether the pad is actually looping right now.
- Tapping a pad surfaces an "Edit Sound" action, opening its own dedicated page for dials/trim — not sharing space with the pad grid.
- Each dial is a slider (-100..100, snapping to 25-point anchors) with its signed value shown alongside — e.g. "+50", not "75%", so it's clear which direction and how far from neutral you are.
- Drag the trim handles on the waveform to choose which part of the recording this pad plays — non-destructive, and independent per pad even when pads share a sample.
- A small tap-to-open info icon next to each dial and the trim control explains what it does.
- Per-pad reset button to snap all dials back to neutral (0, no change) in one click.

### Step 5 — Building a rhythm

- Once the pads are filled in, switch to the Sequencer page (its own dedicated screen, meant to be visited when it's time to assemble — not shared with anything else).
- Active steps show the pad's own color/icon (each pad gets a distinct color/icon when created, for quick visual ID — stable per pad regardless of which sample it currently references).
- Each row shows a small badge whenever that pad is independently looping (via its pad-page loop button), so the sequencer's programmed pattern is never confused with a separate loop already playing.
- Moving playhead highlights the current step across all rows as the sequencer plays.

### Step 6 — Repeating for other pads

- Repeat steps 2–4 (record, review/assign, dial in effects) for each additional pad — or skip recording and assign an existing library sample directly from the Library page. Recording works the same from any page, so this doesn't require navigating back to Pads first.

### Step 7 — Setting the tempo

- BPM dial range: 40–240.
- Numeric BPM value shown next to the dial.

### Step 8 — Playing the sequence

- Single play/pause toggle button.
- A separate toggle to choose "loop continuously" vs "play once then stop."

### Step 9 — Tweaking live

- Dial and step changes apply instantly, even mid-loop (no waiting for the next beat).

### Step 10 — Resetting and stopping

- Browser warns before reload/close if there's in-progress work.
- Explicit "Clear All" button in the settings overlay (gear icon in the top nav) for when you actually want a blank slate, instead of relying on reload.
- A dedicated "stop all sounds" button in the top nav — reachable from every page — panic-stops everything at once: every looping pad, every in-flight one-shot (including a long recording still playing out), and pauses the sequencer if it's running.

## Open Questions (deferred, not blocking)

- Library search (by name) is still open — rename/reorder/delete are in, search isn't yet needed at current library sizes.
- Cross-browser `MediaRecorder` quirks (Safari/iOS codec support) — not a concern unless this ends up used outside one browser.

## Notes

- Personal/casual project, not a portfolio piece — favor quick, fun iteration over polish in the *feature* set. The architecture itself, however, is built deliberately solid so growth doesn't require re-founding it later.
